 - <b>CyberPatriots (National Youth Cyber Defense Competition): </b>CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Education Program created by the Air & Space Forces Association to inspire K-12 students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines critical to our nation's future. At the core of the program is the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, the nation's largest cyber defense competition that puts high school and middle school students in charge of securing virtual networks. I participate in these competitions regularily and have even developed scripts, along with a checklist for the competition. However, due to the confidentiality of these files (as they are resources only for our team), I cannot release these until I have stopped doing CyberPatriots all together.
